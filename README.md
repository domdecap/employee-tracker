# [Note Taker](https://github.com/domdecap/employee-tracker)



## Description

This is a note taker application. The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize myself with Express and further my abilities with Node. This application mainly works by utilizing GET and POST paths.

## Technologies

I used JavaScript, Node, pg, npm, and PostgreSQL.

## Install

Prerequisites: [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en) ```v20.12.2```
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) ```v16.2```

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Open in code editior (I used VS Code).
3. Open a new instance of the integrated terminal.
4. Run ```npm i``` to install dependencies.
5. Log in to PostgreSQL by typing ```psql -U postgres``` and entering your password.
6. Run ```\i db/schema.sql``` to create the database and tables.
7. Run ```\i db/seeds.sql``` to seed the database.

## Usage

After following installation instructions, run ```node server.js``` in the integrated terminal to launch the employee tracker. From there, you should see a list of prompts that you can choose from. Navigate your list of options using your arrow keys. Choose an option using the enter key.

## Contributions

I received help from my tutor Alexis on how to create the View All Employees and Add Emnployee options. I also utilized ChatGPT to help create and debug the remaining functions.
